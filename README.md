# titanic-survival-prediction
Developed as part of my internship, this project applies machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. It demonstrates the complete data science lifecycle — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and Kaggle-style submission — using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
