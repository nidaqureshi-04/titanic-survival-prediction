# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Internship Project)

This machine learning project was developed as part of my internship and is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, class, gender, fare, and more.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a classification model that predicts passenger survival using real-world data, demonstrating practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation — all using Python and Google Colab.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric   | Value           |
|----------|------------------|
| Accuracy | ~83% (Random Forest) |

Random Forest gave the best results for this dataset with balanced performance and interpretability.
